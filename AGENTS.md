## Code Fromatting

- Indentation: 4 spaces.
- Blank Lines: Use to separate logical blocks of code.
- Line Length: Maximum 120 characters.
- Use IntelliJ IDEA default code style for Java.

## Java Style

- Use UTF-8 encoding.
- Use descriptive names for classes, methods, and variables.
- Avoid `var` keyword, prefer explicit types.
- All method parameters should be `final`.
- All variables should be declared as `final` where possible.
- Preference for immutability:
- Avoid mutations of objects, specially when using for-each loops or Stream API using `forEach()`.
- Avoid magic numbers and strings; use constants instead.
- Check emptiness and nullness before operations on collections and strings.
- Avoid methods using `throws` clause; prefer unchecked exceptions.

- Avoid comments.
- Comments could be applied for: cron expressions, Regex patterns, TODOs or given/when/then separation in tests.
- Use `@Override` annotation when overriding methods.
- Avoid Objects.*isNull() and Objects.*nonNull() for one or two variables; prefer direct null checks for better
  performance.
- Wrap multiple conditions in a boolean variable for better readibility
- Prefer early returns.
- Avoid else statements when not necessary and try early returns.

## Lombok Annotations

- Use `@RequiredArgsConstructor` from Lombok for dependency injection via constructor.
- Use `@Slf4j` from Lombok for logging.
- Use `@Builder(setterPrefix = "with"))` for complex object creation.
- Avoid `@Data` annotation; prefer `@Getter` and `@Setter` for granular control.

## Annotations

- **`@Service`**: For business logic classes.
- **`@Repository`**: For data access classes that extend JPA repositories or interact with the database.
- **`@RestController`**: For web controllers.
- **`@Component`**: For generic Spring components.
- **`@Configuration`**: For Spring configuration classes.
- **`@Autowired`**: Prefer constructor injection for production code and field injection only for tests.
- **`@ConfigurationProperties`**: For binding related properties avoid multiple `@Value` annotations. From more than 2
  properties, consider using this annotation.
- **`@Transactional`**: Only Service classes should be annotated with @Transactional at class level to avoid transaction
  management in each method.
- **`@Validated`**: To enable Bean Validation in method parameters or classes.
- **`@PreAuthorize`**: at the controller layer when using Spring Security to enforce method-level security.
- Circular dependencies should be avoided. Avoid `@Order` annotation for dependency resolution.

## Mappers(As a development team choose MapStruct or strictly static Mappers)

**Use MapStruct**

- MapFor mapping between DTOs and entities.
- Define mapper interfaces with `@Mapper` annotation.
- Use `@Mapping` annotation for custom field mappings.
- Use `componentModel = "spring"` to allow Spring to manage mapper instances.
- Mapper should have as suffix `Mapper` (e.g., `UserMapper`).
- Name mapper methods clearly (e.g., `toDto`, `toEntity`).
- Example Mapper Interface:

  ```java
  @Mapper(componentModel = "spring")
  public interface UserMapper {
      @Mapping(source = "email", target = "emailAddress")
      UserDTO toDto(User user);
      @Mapping(source = "emailAddress", target = "email")
      User toEntity(UserDTO userDto);
  }
  ```
